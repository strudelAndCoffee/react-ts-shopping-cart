# React TypeScript Shopping Cart

## A React and TS practice app built following the code-along instructions given in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATafp15HWA) found on the [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDevSimplified) YouTube channel.

This project contains code that I typed out, but I do not own this code. All code belongs to [Web Dev Simplified](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified).

This app was built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
